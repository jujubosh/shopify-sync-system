- **rateLimitMinutes**: Minutes between similar emails (default: 30)
- **quietHours**: Hours when non-critical emails are suppressed

#### Enhanced Reliability

- **retryDelayMs**: Initial delay between retries in milliseconds (default: 5000)
- **exponentialBackoff**: Use exponential backoff for retries (default: true)

- **maxActivityHistory**: Maximum number of activities to track (default: 100)

## Cron Schedule

The system now uses separate cron jobs for different operations:

```bash
# Fulfillment processing - every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * cd /opt/shopify-sync && node scripts/process-all.js fulfillments

# Order imports - every 15 minutes  
*/15 * * * * cd /opt/shopify-sync && node scripts/process-all.js orders

# Inventory sync - every 30 minutes
*/30 * * * * cd /opt/shopify-sync && node scripts/process-all.js inventory

# Full sync with summary - every 2 hours
0 */2 * * * cd /opt/shopify-sync && node scripts/process-all.js all
```

## Email State Tracking

The system maintains an enhanced state file (`logs/email-state.json`) to track:

- **Last Email Times**: When each type of email was last sent
- **Email Counts**: How many times each type has been sent
- **Activity History**: Recent activity for analysis
- **Rate Limiting**: Smart rate limiting with exponential backoff

This file is automatically created and managed.

## New Methods

### Email Statistics
```javascript
const stats = emailNotifier.getEmailStats();
console.log('Total emails sent:', stats.totalEmails);
console.log('Email counts by type:', stats.emailCounts);
console.log('Last email times:', stats.lastEmailTimes);
```

### Reset Email State
```javascript
// Useful for troubleshooting rate limiting issues
emailNotifier.resetEmailState();
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Retry logic and better error handling
2. **Reduced Email Volume**: Only sends emails when there's actual activity
3. **Better Organization**: Separate emails for different operations
4. **Enhanced Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and success rates
5. **Flexible Scheduling**: Different frequencies for different operations
6. **Professional Appearance**: Beautiful HTML templates with branding
7. **Smart Filtering**: Quiet hours and enhanced rate limiting
8. **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design for mobile devices
9. **Debug Capabilities**: Optional debug information for troubleshooting
10. **Activity Analytics**: Track and analyze email patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Being Sent

1. Check if email notifications are enabled in config
2. Verify the specific alert type is enabled
3. Check if activity threshold is met
4. Verify rate limiting isn't blocking the email
5. Check if currently in quiet hours (for non-error emails)
6. Validate Mailgun credentials are configured
7. Check email state file for rate limiting issues

### Too Many Emails

1. Increase `rateLimitMinutes` in config
2. Increase `minActivityThreshold` 
3. Adjust `quietHours` to suppress more emails
4. Disable specific alert types you don't need
5. Enable exponential backoff for error emails

### Email State Issues

If rate limiting seems stuck, you can reset the email state:

```bash
rm /opt/shopify-sync/logs/email-state.json
```

Or use the new reset method:

```javascript
emailNotifier.resetEmailState();
```

The system will recreate the file on next run.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug information to troubleshoot email issues:

```json
{
  "emailNotifications": {
    "includeDebugInfo": true
  }
}
```

This will add debug headers to emails with rate limiting and timing information.

## Migration from Old System

The new system is backward compatible. Existing configurations will work, but you may want to:

1. Enable the new alert types you want
2. Adjust the rate limiting settings
3. Set appropriate quiet hours
4. Update the cron schedule using the new deployment script
5. Consider enabling activity tracking for better analytics
6. Configure retry settings for better reliability

## Performance Monitoring

The system now provides better monitoring capabilities:

- **Email Statistics**: Track total emails sent and success rates
- **Activity History**: Monitor patterns in email activity
- **Rate Limiting**: Visual indicators of rate limiting status
- **Success Rates**: Progress bars showing operation success rates

## Mobile Optimization

All email templates are now optimized for mobile devices:

- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly buttons and links
- Optimized typography for mobile reading
- Proper scaling of images and content
- Enhanced readability on small screens
